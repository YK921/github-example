# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods 
## San Francisco safe travel and restaurant visits


* 1. A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. 


San Francisco is a fairly large city in the United States, the hub of business, finance, and transportation. This city must be an attractive city for many tourists. Unfortunately, a variety of crimes occurred in this city during 2018. I would like to analyze San Francisco's crime patterns by time and region to introduce safer and better neighborhoods for tourists and to recommend good restaurants to visit.



* 2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. 


The data can be obtained from the following link. This data includes information such as the time of crime, the type of crime, and the area where the crime occurred. By analyzing and visualizing this data, we will use it as proactive information to help us avoid dangerous risks. In addition, we will use the Foursquare API to add the necessary information based on data such as the location and type of restaurants in the San Francisco area.
